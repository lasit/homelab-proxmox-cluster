**Uptime:** Freshly restarted after rack migration  
**Last Incident:** Rack migration completed successfully

## 🚦 Quick Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Proxmox Cluster** | ✅ Healthy | 3 nodes, quorum established |
| **Ceph Storage** | ✅ HEALTH_OK | 508GB available, 3x replication |
| **Network** | ✅ Operational | All VLANs active, routing working |
| **Containers** | ✅ 9/9 Running | All containers up (Redis service inactive) |
| **Backups** | ✅ Automated | Daily 02:00, Mac Pro NAS mounted |
| **Remote Access** | ✅ Active | Tailscale operational |
| **DNS** | ✅ Working | Pi-hole operational |
| **Mac Pro NAS** | ✅ Operational | SSHFS mounted, Pegasus storage online |
| **UniFi WiFi** | ✅ Operational | 3 APs, 3 SSIDs, controller on CT107 |

## 🔴 Active Issues

### 1. Mac Pro Pegasus Auto-Mount
- **Impact:** Low - requires manual intervention after cold boot
- **Cause:** Boot timing - Thunderbolt device not ready when systemd runs
- **Workaround:** Run `sudo /usr/local/bin/mount-pegasus.sh` after boot
- **Status:** Service is enabled, but timing issue persists

### 2. Redis Service Not Running
- **Impact:** None - Nextcloud works without cache
- **Cause:** systemd namespace issues in unprivileged LXC
- **Workaround:** Not needed currently
- **Fix Plan:** Redeploy with Docker when needed
