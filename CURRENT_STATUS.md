# üìä Current Homelab Status

**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 5 Complete - Awaiting Router Hardware  
**Cluster Health:** ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL (but not accessible)

## üî• Quick Status Dashboard

```
Cluster:     ‚úÖ 3 nodes, quorum established
Networking:  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Awaiting Protectli VP2420 router
Storage:     ‚úÖ Ceph HEALTH_OK, 515GB raw, 172GB usable
Services:    ‚è≥ Ready to deploy after router installation
Remote:      ‚è≥ Tailscale pending
```

## üö® Current Situation

**Router Status:** Original OPNsense router removed due to single NIC limitation. Protectli VP2420 ordered (4x 2.5GbE Intel NICs) - expected delivery within 1-2 weeks.

**Temporary Network:** ISP router connected directly to UniFi switch. Ubuntu laptop and iMac have internet via 10.1.1.x network. Proxmox nodes not accessible until router installed.

## üìã Completed Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: OPNsense Router (Oct 22, 2025)
- Initially installed on HP Elite Mini
- Configured with VLANs
- **Issue discovered:** Single NIC insufficient

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Network Configuration (Oct 22, 2025)
- UniFi switch VLAN configuration complete
- Trunk ports configured
- Currently in temporary mode

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Proxmox Installation (Oct 23, 2025)
- All three nodes installed
- VLAN-aware bridges configured
- Network verified when router was present

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Cluster Creation (Oct 23, 2025)
- Cluster "homelab" created
- All nodes joined successfully
- Quorum established
- Corosync on VLAN 20

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Ceph Storage (Oct 23, 2025)
- Ceph installed and configured
- 3 monitors, 3 OSDs
- Storage pool healthy
- 515 GiB raw storage available

## üéØ Next Actions

### Immediate (When Router Arrives)
1. Install OPNsense on Protectli VP2420
2. Configure WAN on Port 1 (to ISP router)
3. Configure LAN with VLANs on Port 2 (to switch)
4. Restore switch port configurations
5. Verify cluster accessibility

### Phase 6 Deployment (After Router Setup)
- Week 1: Tailscale, Pi-hole, Nginx Proxy Manager
- Week 2: Backup infrastructure
- Week 3: Home Assistant migration
- Month 2: Additional services

## üîß Recent Changes

### October 25, 2025

- **Storage:** 172GB Ceph (replicated)
- **Local Storage:** 600GB (200GB per node)

## üõçÔ∏è Hardware Orders

| Item | Model | Price | Status | Expected |

## üìû Quick Reference

### When Router Installed
```bash
# Access nodes
ssh root@192.168.10.11  # pve1
ssh root@192.168.10.12  # pve2
ssh root@192.168.10.13  # pve3

# Web interfaces
https://192.168.10.1    # OPNsense
https://192.168.10.11:8006  # Proxmox
```

### Current Temporary Access
```bash
# UniFi Controller
https://10.1.1.45:8443  # From Ubuntu laptop

# Home Assistant
http://pifrontdoor.local:8123
```

**Note:** Cluster is healthy but inaccessible until router installation. No action needed on Proxmox nodes - they're running fine and waiting for network routing to be restored.
