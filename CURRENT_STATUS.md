## 🔴 Active Issues

### 1. ProtonVPN Blocks Tailscale DNS
- **Impact:** Low - only affects remote access with ProtonVPN active
- **Cause:** ProtonVPN's DNS leak protection intercepts all DNS queries
- **Workaround:** Disconnect ProtonVPN when accessing homelab remotely
- **Status:** Known limitation, documented in troubleshooting guide

## 🟢 Recently Resolved

### ISP WiFi Migration (COMPLETED 2025-12-07)
- **Change:** Migrated all IoT devices from ISP router WiFi to UniFi WiFi
- **Why:** Consolidate all WiFi under UniFi management, prepare to disable ISP WiFi
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Created new WiFi SSID "iiNetBC09FB" on VLAN 60 (IoT) matching ISP credentials
  2. Configured WPA2 security with 2.4GHz + 5GHz bands
  3. Broadcast from AP-Upstairs and AP-Downstairs
  4. Disabled ISP WiFi networks
  5. All IoT devices automatically reconnected to new UniFi network
- **Status:** ✅ All devices migrated successfully

### Pi (pifrontdoor) Wired Migration (COMPLETED 2025-12-07)
- **Change:** Moved Home Assistant Pi from WiFi to wired Ethernet
- **Why:** More reliable connection, WiFi no longer needed
- **Previous Config:** WiFi on ISP network (10.1.1.63 static)
- **New Config:** Wired Ethernet on Default VLAN (192.168.1.146 DHCP reserved)
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Disabled WiFi interface (wlan0) on Home Assistant OS
  2. Enabled Ethernet interface (enu1u1u1) with DHCP
  3. Connected via passive switch on Port 7
  4. Created DHCP reservation in OPNsense (MAC: B8:27:EB:01:E3:C3)
  5. Updated Tailscale advertised routes to include 192.168.1.0/24
  6. Verified remote access via Tailscale
- **Access:** http://192.168.1.146:8123 or http://pifrontdoor.local:8123
- **Status:** ✅ Fully operational, accessible locally and via Tailscale

### Backup Storage Migration (COMPLETED 2025-12-05)
- **Change:** Migrated backup storage from Mac Pro + Pegasus to G-Drive USB-C
- **Why:** Mac Pro was overkill for backup needs (~340W vs ~5W), complex Thunderbolt/stex driver issues
- **Status:** ✅ Fully operational, test backup successful

### DNS over Tailscale (RESOLVED 2025-12-03)
- **Issue:** DNS queries to Pi-hole timed out when accessing homelab via Tailscale
- **Solution:** Added static route in OPNsense + configured Tailscale admin DNS
- **Status:** ✅ Fully working (when ProtonVPN disconnected)
